        <p>
          This policy applies to information that Platform Cyber collects across
          all of our augmented reality products and services, and when you
          otherwise interact with us. An overview of our products and services,
          including how to find even more detailed information for each
          generation of such products and services, is available below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that this policy only applies to Platform Cyber. When you
          use third party products and services that are designed for use with
          our products, such as third party applications and solutions available
          for your Platform Cyber device of any generation, what information is
          collected and how it is used by that third party is not controlled by
          Platform Cyber. Be sure to review the privacy practices of these third
          parties prior to using their products or services with Platform Cyber
          products to better understand how those third parties collect, use, or
          share your information.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          Further, if you are using a Platform Cyber product or service provided
          by your employer, then your employer, and not Platform Cyber,
          determines what information it collects regarding your use of such
          Platform Cyber products or services, as well as how any such
          information will be used or shared by your employer. Be sure to review
          your employer’s policies to better understand how your employer
          handles your information.
